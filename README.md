## Main subject for this project
1. Does the prediction data can help the total reward of Reinforcement Learning Agents?
2. What prediction model would be helpful? (Currently working on DLinear from LSTF-Linear)

LSTF-Linear: https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear

4. And what combinations of future steps are optimal?
5. Does Ensemble Learning can reduce the variance?

Main Objectives
Enhancing Reinforcement Learning Performance: Investigate the impact of prediction data on the total reward of Reinforcement Learning agents in algorithmic trading.
Identifying Effective Prediction Models: Explore different prediction models to determine which ones can significantly contribute to improving trading performance. Currently, we are working on DLinear from LSTF-Linear, an open-source project focused on linear financial time series forecasting.
LSTF-Linear: GitHub
Optimizing Future Step Combinations: Evaluate the performance of Reinforcement Learning agents with various combinations of future steps to identify the most optimal configuration.
Variance Reduction through Ensemble Learning: Investigate the potential of ensemble learning techniques to reduce the variance in the trading strategy and enhance overall stability.
