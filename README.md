## Main Objectives of this Project
1. **Enhancing Reinforcement Learning Performance**: Investigate the impact of prediction data on the total reward of Reinforcement Learning agents in algorithmic trading.
2. **Identifying Effective Prediction Models**: Explore different prediction models to determine which ones can significantly contribute to improving trading performance. Currently, we are working on DLinear from LSTF-Linear, an open-source project focused on linear financial time series forecasting.

3. **Optimizing Future Step Combinations**: Evaluate the performance of Reinforcement Learning agents with various combinations of future steps to identify the most optimal configuration.
4. **Variance Reduction through Ensemble Learning**: Investigate the potential of ensemble learning techniques to reduce the variance in the trading strategy and enhance overall stability.
